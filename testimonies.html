                                <p>I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Barbie to both buy a house and to sell a house. In both instances, Barbie and her team were on top of all matters, which helped to make stressful moving transitions less stressful due to their competence and professionalism. Anyone interested in a real estate career should follow Barbie around to see the qualities that are needed to be successful in this profession. With my latest interaction with Barbie, she was creative in her approach to selling my home (it was under contract in two days). Barbie is driven with a terrific work ethic and was always in contact by phone, text, and email to keep me informed on how things were progressing especially before the home entered the market and when minor repairs were needed resulting from the home inspection. Last, and most importantly, Barbie is highly ethical and I consider her a good friend due to her honesty and integrity. I would have no hesitation recommending her for anyone that is in need of an experienced and knowledgeable real estate professional.</p>
                                <p>Take care and hope you had a good weekend! FYI, I still havent received check as of Saturday, October 27th.</p>

                                <p>I first met Barbie at a Senior Seminar at the Pagoda Hotel around the beginning of 2017. After my oldest sister passed away in July 2017, I started thinking about selling the old family home. I needed to downsize from this big 4 bedroom/2 story home to a one bedroom condo. My parents originally purchased the home back in the 1930s. Over the years they made improvements and kept the house in good shape. My nephew and 2 nieces were part owners of the house. I discussed with them about selling and they agreed to it. I decided to contact Barbie because she has always genuinely shown care regarding senior citizens. Barbie not only was instrumental in selling our family home, but also helped me find a one bedroom condo for myself.</p>
                                
                                <p>Her knowledge in real estate and her tireless patience is such a great asset.</p>

We met Barbie through a close friend while she was helping him find another investment property to add to his own real estate portfolio and we instantly knew we wanted to work with her. Barbie is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and very easy to talk to. You can tell she really cares about us as people and not just as clients. She was always available to answer any questions we had and was supportive throughout the entire process. We really could not have done this without her. We are so grateful to have met her and will most definitely turn to Barbie for any future real estate needs and confidently refer her to any friends or family in need of an excellent realtor!</p>

                                    Purchasing a home is always a stressful experience, however, Steven and Kelsey made the overall process very easy and seamless. They are an efficient team with excellent communication skills. I will definitely recommend their services to anyone who is thinking about buying a home. Thanks again for such a positive experience!

                                    We were very fortunate in having you for our realtors, doing all 
                                    the legwork and more. All we needed to do was come up with the cash. I 
                                    was pleasantly surprised that we started and closed within a couple of 
                                    months. The coordination that you did with Rae and your team in LV and 
                                    when we were there, was excellent. I certainly will recommend you folks 
                                    to our friends.

                                <p>Roy and I would like to say thank you and Darrell, for all your help in purchasing our forever home in Las Vegas. We went to your seminar just to see what you guys were all about and from your first presentation, you captured our attention. Mind you, we had been talking to a realtor in Vegas, whom we had to inform that we ultimately chose to work with Xpand Realty. You guys made everything so easy and step by step instructions were so clear. Always checking up on us to see if we were okay and never once did we feel pressured to make a decision of any kind!</p>
                                <p>As you know, we will be selling our place here in Honolulu. When that time comes, you KNOW we will call you and rely on your expertise again!</p>
                                <p>We truly appreciate all you and Darrell have done for us and we look forward to working with you guys in the near future!</p>
                                <p>With Warmest Aloha,</p>

                                    I just wanted to say a quick thank you for all the assistance you gave me before my retirement. You were quietly persistent, considerate of my time and I appreciated your follow-up...and you never forgot to follow-up on our conversations!

                                    Your presentation was friendly, professional, detailed and flexible. We often needed changes to the contract, and you were usually the one to came up with the solutions we needed. Most importantly, you always lived by your word.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You have all the qualities of a successful real estate professional. It was my absolute privilege and any buyer or seller will be lucky to have you represent them.

                                <p>Darrell Kimura recently helped me with a purchase of an investment property in Las Vegas. He presented me with several quality properties that fit my criteria. Each one had an analysis based upon my investment goals. His knowledge and analytical reasoning made it easy to make a solid decision.  I ended up with the perfect property with the perfect tenant. He advised me during the whole buying process. It went very smoothly.  I plan to use Darrell again for my future Las Vegas purchases.</p>

                                    As nerve wracking as it can be in selling a home, we were extremely satisfied in choosing Darrell Kimura as our agent to sell our property in Hawaii.  He was upfront and straightforward with us in having realistic expectations in the process.  He gave us a guideline in what we needed to do to our home to get the most value. He not only got us a selling price within our expectations, but even after he sold our home, he continued to offer any help he could in making sure our relocation to Las Vegas was on track.
